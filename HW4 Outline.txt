Bank Account Class:
	- Customer object - I think I have this backwards, but I feel it makes more sense to associate customer accounts with the customer rather than associate specific account types with customers
	- balance
~methods
		- withdraw
		- deposit
		~Class methods - Possible we might want this
			- getAccountInfo - returns min balances and fees for all account types - over write in the account subclasses so the classes will just return their own minimums and fees/intrest

	Checking Class:
		- fee
		- max withdraw for minors

	Savings Class:
		- interest rate - How should we implement this? Log day the account was created and calculate interest based on account age? a special method that gets called once a day at a certain time?
